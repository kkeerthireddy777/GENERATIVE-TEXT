## Project Overview

This project presents a simple yet powerful **Generative Text Tool** that leverages the GPT-2 language model to produce coherent and contextually relevant paragraphs based on user input prompts. Designed for both learning and real-world applications, the model can generate creative, informative, or technical text on any topic entered by the user.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how transformer-based models can be fine-tuned or used directly for content creation, writing assistants, storytelling, and educational tools. The notebook interface is beginner-friendly and showcases how AI can automate paragraph writing with minimal code.

## How the Project Works (Architecture)

1. Text Input
Users enter a prompt (e.g., "The future of robotics") through the notebook or Colab interface.

2. Prompt Processing
The prompt is tokenized using GPT-2â€™s tokenizer and sent to the model to begin generating text.

3. Text Generation
The model uses:
- **Top-p sampling** and
- **Temperature tuning**  
to create fluent and varied output.

4. Output Display
The generated paragraph is decoded and printed in the notebook for immediate use or further refinement.

## Future Improvements

- Add a web interface using **Streamlit** or **Gradio**
- Allow prompt styles: **Creative**, **Formal**, **Technical**
- Add model selection (e.g., GPT-2 vs GPT-2 Medium)
- Provide options for output length
- Add the ability to continue/edit previous generations
